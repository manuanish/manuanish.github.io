In this post I will be explaining how I created my graph for the [Beach/Summer
Graph Contest](https://princetonk12.instructure.com/courses/6508/discussion_topics/213397).
<br />
<br />
### Defining the pixel

Let's begin by looking at the graph of the following
function. For *each pixel* I have used the following polar graph:

$$
r \leq \sin(\theta)
$$

If we graph this, we get a circle at the center of the coordinate plane. (As shown below)

<br />
<BlogImage src="/blog/circle.png" width={2880} height={1538} />
<br />
<br />
Using this very basic starting point, we can now create all sorts of images.
<br />
<br />
### Creating the python script

Using the python library `Pillow`, we can get the
exact colors of pixels at certain points in an image. This can be done quite easily
like so:
<br />
<br />
```py
# main.py

from PIL import Image

im = Image.open('small-beach.jpg')
pix = im.load()

print(pix[0, 0])
````
<br/>
<br/>
For example, the code above will return the color of the pixel at position `0, 0`. We can run this code in a loop to reapeat this process for each pixel
and graph a circle with the color with the following code.
<br/>
<br/>
```py
# main.py

from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

im = Image.open('small-beach.jpg')
pix = im.load()

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

def cc(input):
    return (input[0]/255, input[1]/255, input[2]/255)

for i in range(300):
    for j in range(300):
        ax.add_patch(plt.Circle(((j/im.size[1]), (i/im.size[0])), 1/1000, color=cc(pix[i, j])))

fig.savefig('output.png')
````

<br />
<br />

### Using the script

Using the script we can retrive extremely high quality images quite easily. For example, consider the following image:

<br />
<br />
<BlogImage
  src="/blog/small-beach.jpg"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  caption="Image source: Microsoft"
/>
<br />
<br />
If we run the script, we obtain the following image:
<br />
<br />
<BlogImage
  src="/blog/output.png"
  width={500}
  height={500}
  caption="Final graph."
/>
<br />
<br />
Notice that the image is rotated. Why is this? Because of the way the pixels were
graphed the image turns out to be $90^\circ$ rotated than it was initially made.
<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Some lower quality images

Because the high quality image can be quite hard to believe here are some of the zoomed in images of the script

<br/>
<br/>
<BlogImage src="/blog/output0.png" width={500} height={500} caption="Zoomed in on the sky extremely"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<BlogImage src="/blog/output1.png" width={500} height={500} caption="Now its starting to come together!"/>
<br/>
<br/>
#### Why I couldn't use Desmos
[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) limits the number of graphs the you can use to about $1,000$ per page. For the beach image which was `300 x 300` pixels I would need
at least $90,000$ individual graphs to produce the high quality image that you are viewing.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Technical equations used for graphing
Given a polar function $f(r)$ we define the function graphed at some $(x, y)$ to be given as $f_{(x, y)}(r)$. Define the width of the image to be $w = \{1, 2, 3, \cdots, 300\}$
and similarly the height $h = \{1, 2, 3, \cdots, 300\}$. Then, the graph can be given as the following.
$$
\forall \ i \in w, \forall \ j \in h \implies f_{(i, j - 1/2)}(r) \leq \sin(\theta)
$$
