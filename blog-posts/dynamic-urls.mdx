Logging some breaking changes in the backend of my website and finally coming
around to adding Dynamic URLs for the blog!

<br/>
### What are Dynamic URLs?
Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications.
Dynamic URLs are used for simplifying the development process for creating many copies
of visually similar pages (in the case the blog posts).

<div className="flex-row sm:flex md:flex lg:flex justify-center gap-2">
<div className="grow w-full">
<Note type="error" label="Don't">predefine every static page.</Note>

```
/blog/beach-graph-contest
/blog/lxxiii-the-end
/blog/lxxiii-uncovered
```
</div>
<br/>
<div className="grow w-full">
<Note type="success" label="Do">use a single dynamic route.</Note>

```

/blog/[slug]


```
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
### Changes in the development experience
This makes it much easier to focus on what matters most; content!
<br/>
<Note type="error" label="Don't">wrestle with long import statements</Note>
<br/>
```jsx
import Header from "@components/Header";
import Author from "@components/Author";
import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage";
import BlogTitle from "@components/BlogTitle";
import PageTitle from "@components/PageTitle";
import { User, Note, Collapse } from "@geist-ui/core";
import Twemoji from "@components/Twemoji";
import ELADemo from "@components/blog/ELADemo";
import VisibilityDemo from "@components/blog/VisibilityDemo";
import Tags from "@components/Tags";


<Header dir={["blog", "lxxiii-uncovered"]} />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<PageTitle title="manuanish | LXXIII. Uncovered." />
<Tags tags={["Princeton", "Puzzle", "Solutions", "Interactive", "Well-written"]} />
<br/>
<BlogTitle>LXXIII. Uncovered.</BlogTitle>
<Author userName="manuanish" readTime={15} date="20/6/22" />
<br />
---
```

<br/>

<Note type="success" label="Do">use simple YAML frontmatter</Note>
<br/>
```md
---
title: "LXXIII. Uncovered."
description: "Solutions to the puzzle LXXIII."
date: "20/6/2022"
userName: "manuanish"
readTime: "15"
tag1: "Princeton"
tag2: "Puzzle"
tag3: "Solutions"
tag4: "Interactive"
tag5: "Well-written"
---
```
<br/>
<br/>
### Automatic Updates
Using dynamic URLs also allows me to automatically update each page with the latest
content without manually adding new components. For example, the `/blog/` directory
will automatically be update with the latest post, tags and more.
